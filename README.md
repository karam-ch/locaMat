/app:

/bootstrap:
Contains the app.php file which bootstraps the framework. This directory also holds the cache files used to optimize performance.

/config:
Contains all of your application's configuration files. Each file corresponds to a different aspect of your Laravel application, such as database, mail, services, and more.

/database:
Contains database migration and seed files, allowing you to define your database's structure and initial test data.

/node_modules:

The entry point for all requests entering your application. It contains assets like images, JavaScript, and CSS.

/resources:
Contains views (Blade templates), raw assets (LESS, SASS, JavaScript), and language files.

All the application routes are defined here. Laravel comes with several route files: web.php, api.php, console.php, and channels.php.

/storage:
Used for storing compiled Blade templates, file-based sessions, file caches, and other files generated by the framework. This directory is segregated into app, framework, and logs directories.

Your application's environment-specific variables will be set here. It's not tracked by Git for security reasons.
